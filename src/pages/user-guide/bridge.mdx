Click the `Bridge`` button in the navigation bar to open the Bridge app, which is based on [Hop Exchange]('https://hop.exchange/') UI. The Bridge supports **Deposit** and **Withdraw** operations.

## Deposit from Scroll L1 to Scroll L2

### Instructions

1. First, switch to the **Scroll L1** network in your wallet.
1. In the bridge app, ensure that **Scroll L1** is on top and **Scroll L2** is on the bottom. You can click the "**↓**" button to switch the positions.
1. Select the token (`TSETH` or `TSUSDC`) that you want to transfer from Scroll L1 to Scroll L2.
1. If this is your first time transferring TSUSDC token, you need to **Approve** the Scroll L1 Bridge contract to access your TSUSDC token.
1. Next, click the **Send** button to make the deposit. Your wallet will pop up a window asking for confirmation of the transfer transaction.
1. Once the transfer transaction is sent and confirmed, the token will be deducted from your Scroll L1 wallet.

### When will the token arrive in your Scroll L2 wallet?

It takes about **2 minutes** (6 block confirmations on Scroll L1) before the token shows up in your Scroll L2 wallet. You can check the progress of deposit transactions as follows:

1. Click your wallet address at the top-right corner of the Bridge web app. The pop-up panel lists the most recent 3 transactions that you made in the Bridge app (see the image below).

1. Click the transaction hash of the recent deposit. It will open the _Transaction Details_ page in a new tab. You can find the block number containing this transaction.

   <img src={transactionDetails} alt="Viewing the transaction details and block number of bridging an asset." />

1. You can then check the latest block height in the [Scroll L1 Block Explorer]('https://l1scan.scroll.io/'). If the difference between the latest block height and the block number in Step 2 is greater than 6, the deposited token should be funded in your Scroll L2 wallet.

## Withdraw from Scroll L2 to Scroll L1

### Instructions

1. First, switch to the Scroll L2 network in your wallet.
1. In the bridge app, make sure that Scroll L2 is on top, and Scroll L1 is on the bottom. You can click the "↓" button to switch the positions.
1. Select the token (TSETH or TSUSDC) that you want to transfer from Scroll L2 to Scroll L1.
1. If this is your first time transferring TSUSDC token, you need to Approve the L2 Bridge contract to access your TSUSDC token.
1. Next, click the Send button to make the withdrawal. Your wallet will pop up a window asking for confirmation of the transfer transaction.
1. Once the transfer transaction is sent and confirmed, the token will be deducted from your Scroll L2 wallet.

### When will the token arrive in your Scroll L1 wallet?

The transferred token will arrive in your Scroll L1 wallet after the Scroll L2 block containing this withdrawal transaction is Finalized. On our Pre-Alpha Testnet, it will take tens of minutes to a few hours for a Scroll L2 block to be finalized, but we expect this time to be significantly lower on Mainnet.

> The rollup status `Finalized` indicates that the correct execution of transactions in this block has been proven by verifying
> a validity proof on-chain on Scroll L1. For more information about rollup status, see [Scroll's Architecture Overview]('https://scroll.mirror.xyz/nDAbJbSIJdQIWqp9kn8J0MVS4s6pYBwHmK7keidQs-k').

You can check the progress of withdrawal transactions as follows:

1. Click your wallet address at the top-right corner of the Bridge web app. The pop-up panel lists the most recent 3 transactions you made in the Bridge app (see the image below).

1. Open the [Rollup Explorer]('https://scroll.io/prealpha/rollupscan') and check the rollup status of the corresponding block. If the block is finalized, the transferred token should be funded in your Scroll L1 wallet.
