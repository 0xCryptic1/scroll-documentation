### Welcome to Scroll's Alpha Testnet!

Thank you for testing out our Alpha Testnet. If you have questions or want to give feedback, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/scroll)!

The Alpha Testnet consists of _Ethereum's_ _Goerli Testnet_ and the _Scroll Alpha_ test network. Goerli is an Ethereum test network with PoS-based consensus, while Scroll Alpha is a zero-knowledge rollup testnet deployed on top of the former. There are some pre-deployed demo applications: a bridge between _Goerli_ and _Scroll Alpha_ based on the [Hop Exchange](https://hop.exchange/) UI, a block explorer for _Scroll Alpha_ using [Blockscout](https://blockscout.com/), and a rollup explorer.

To view submitted transactions, check out Ethereum's official Goerli block explorers on [Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/) and [Blockscout](https://eth-goerli.blockscout.com/). \
\_\_

Here is the suggested workflow to explore the Testnet:

1. Add the [**Alpha Testnet**](https://scroll.io/alpha) configurations to your wallet.
2. Request test tokens in the _Goerli_ network from any Ethereum Faucet app. ([example](https://goerlifaucet.com/))
3. Transfer test tokens from _Goerli_ to _Scroll Alpha_ through the **Bridge** app.
4. Transfer tokens to other wallets on _Scroll Alpha_ using your wallet.
5. View the status of transactions and blocks in the **Goerli & Alpha Block Explorers** and the **Rollup Explorer**.
6. Withdraw tokens from _Scroll Alpha_ to _Goerli_ through the **Bridge** app.

You can find the instructions for each app in the rest of this user guide.
