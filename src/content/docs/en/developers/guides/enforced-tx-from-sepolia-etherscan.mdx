The Enforced Transaction deployed on Sepolia is the most direct and permisionless way to send a transaction from L1 to L2. In this guide we will launch a Greeter contract on L2 and set the greeter value from Sepolia L1 from the Sepolia Etherscan UI.

#### Target Smart Contract

Let’s start by deploying the target smart contract on Scroll testnet. On this guide we will be using a Greeter contract and we will use Remix to deploy it and interact with it. Keep in mind that you can deploy any other contract with the tool of your choice.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.21;

// This Greeter contract will be interacted with through the EnforcedTransaction contract deployed on Sepolia
contract Greeter {
  string public greeting = "Hello World!";

  // This function will be called by sendTransaction on Sepolia
  function setGreeting(string memory greeting_) public {
    greeting = greeting_;
  }

  // This function is not mandatory, is just a convinient way of getting the data needed to execute the setGreeting function from an external source
  function getEncodedData(string memory greeting_) public pure returns (bytes memory) {
    return abi.encodeWithSignature("setGreeting(string)", greeting_);
  }
}
```

Once your contract contract is deployed, execute the `getEncodedData` by passing as parameter the new greeting that will be set from L1, try passing `“Crosschain message!”` as parameter. It will return a big sequence of bytes. Save both the result of the function call and the contract address because both will be needed later.

#### Sending an enforced transaction from Sepolia Etherscan

Now go to the [EnforcedTransaction contract tab](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x97f421ca37889269a11ae0fef558114b984c7487#writeProxyContract#F3) on Sepolia Scan and execute the sendTransaction by passing the following params:

- `payableAmount`: The amount of ETH used to pay gas on L2 `0.001` should be more than enough.
- `target`: The address of the Greeter smart contract deployed on L2.
- `value`: Pass 0 as param becuase the `setGreeting` function is not payable.
- `gasLimit`: The amount gas limit to execute the transaction on L2. `200000` should be enough.
- `data`: The big sequence of bytes you got from calling the `getEncodedData` function on your Greeter contract.

After executing and confirming the transaction on Sepolia, the new state of `greeting` on the `Greeter` contract should be `“Crosschain message!”` or any message you set when calling `getEncodedData`. Sending a message from Sepolia to Scroll testnet should take around 20mins after the transactions are confirmed on Sepolia.
