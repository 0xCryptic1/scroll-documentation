After deploying your smart contracts, it's important to verify your code on [our block explorer](https://blockscout.scroll.io/). This can be done in an automated way using your developer tooling or using Blockscout's Web UI.

<Aside type="danger" title="Warning">
  Our Blockscout instance currently has inconsistent behavior in verifying contracts with Foundry. We're working on a
  fix, along with other stability improvements. Don't hesitate to come ask for help [on
  Discord](https://discord.com/channels/853955156100907018/1028102371894624337) though.

## Using Developer Tools

Most smart contract tooling has plugins for verifying your contracts easily on Etherscan. Blockscout supports Etherscan's contract verification APIs, and it's straight forward to use these tools with the Scroll Alpha Testnet.

### Hardhat

First, modify `hardhat.config.ts` to point to Scroll's RPC and `blockscout.scroll.io/api`. A dummy `apyKey` value is required, but anything works for its value.

```javascript
...

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  ...
  networks: {
    scrollAlpha: {
      url: 'https://alpha-rpc.scroll.io/l2' || '',
      accounts:
        process.env.PRIVATE_KEY !== undefined ? [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] : [],
    },
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      scrollAlpha: 'abc',
    },
    customChains: [
      {
        network: 'scrollAlpha',
        chainId: 534353,
        urls: {
          apiURL: 'https://blockscout.scroll.io/api',
          browserURL: 'https://blockscout.scroll.io/',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}

...
```

Now you can verify the smart contract by running the following command.

```solidity
npx hardhat verify --network scrollAlpha <contract address> <space separated constructor parameters>
```

For example, this how a smart contract that receives two uint parameters in the constructor would look like.

```solidity
npx hardhat verify --network scrollAlpha 0xD9880690bd717189cC3Fbe7B9020F27fae7Ac76F 123 456
```

<Aside type="danger" title="Warning">
  You may receive an error stating `etherscan.apiKey.trim is not a function` . If so, you need to update
  `@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan` to be able to support custom chains. Try running `npm update
  @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan`

### Foundry

When using Foundry, the `verify-contract` helps us verifying contracts.

```bash
forge verify-contract <Contract Address> <Space separated params> <Solidity file>:<Contract name> --chain-id 534353 --verifier-url <https://blockscout.scroll.io/api> --verifier blockscout
```
