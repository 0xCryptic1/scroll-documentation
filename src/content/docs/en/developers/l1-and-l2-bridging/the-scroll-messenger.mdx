import Aside from "../../../../../components/Aside.astro"

You can send arbitrary messages from L1 to L2 or vice versa through the Scroll Messenger contracts. This means we can execute functions on another chain in a secure and permissionless way. If you want to send a message from L1 to L2, use the messenger smart contract deployed on L1. If you want to send a message from L2 to L1, use the contract deployed on L1.

<Aside type="caution" title="">
  When sending a transaction through the **Scroll Messenger** deployed on L1 and L2, the resulting transaction sender
  (`CALLER` or `msg.sender`) will be the Messenger Contract address deployed on the receiving chain. In future Scroll
  versions, enforced transactions will be introduced as a L1 contract. Sending enforced transactions will allow setting
  the sender on L2 as the original one on L1. It will also allow 3rd parties to relay signed transactions and also
  setting the&#x20;

### sendMessage

```solidity
function sendMessage(
  address target,
  uint256 value,
  bytes calldata message,
  uint256 gasLimit,
  address refundAddress
) external payable;
```

Sends arbitrary data from one chain to another. It allows us to execute functions cross-chain.

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| target        | The address of account who receive the message. The receiver can be either a smart contract or a EOA wallet. |
| value         | The amount of ether passed when call target contract.                                                        |
| message       | The content of the message. This is the arbitrary calldata to be executed.                                   |
| gasLimit      | Gas limit required to complete the message relay on corresponding chain.                                     |
| refundAddress | The address of account who will receive the refunded fee.                                                    |

### relayMessageWithProof

```solidity
function relayMessageWithProof(
  address from,
  address to,
  uint256 value,
  uint256 nonce,
  bytes memory message,
  L2MessageProof memory proof
) external;
```

Relay a L2 => L1 message with message proof.

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| from      | The address of the sender of the message.                    |
| to        | The address of the recipient of the message.                 |
| value     | The msg.value passed to the message call.                    |
| nonce     | The nonce of the message to avoid replay attack.             |
| message   | The content of the message.                                  |
| proof     | The proof used to verify the correctness of the transaction. |
