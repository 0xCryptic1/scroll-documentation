import Aside from "../../../../../components/Aside.astro"

You can send arbitrary messages from L1 to L2 or vice versa through the Scroll Messenger contracts. This means we can execute functions on another chain in a secure and permissionless way. If you want to send a message from L1 to L2, use the messenger smart contract deployed on L1. If you want to send a message from L2 to L1, use the contract deployed on L1.

<Aside type="caution" title="">
  When sending a transaction through the **Scroll Messenger** deployed on L1 and L2, the resulting transaction sender
  (`CALLER` or `msg.sender`) will be the Messenger Contract address deployed on the receiving chain. In future Scroll
  versions, enforced transactions will be introduced as a L1 contract. Sending enforced transactions will allow setting
  the sender on L2 as the original one on L1. It will also allow 3rd parties to relay signed transactions and also
  setting the&#x20;

## Messenger API

Please visit the [npm library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scroll-tech/contracts?activeTab=code) for the complete Scroll contract API documentation.

### sendMessage

```solidity
function sendMessage(
  address target,
  uint256 value,
  bytes calldata message,
  uint256 gasLimit,
  address refundAddress
) external payable;
```

Sends arbitrary data from one chain to another. It allows us to execute functions cross-chain.
