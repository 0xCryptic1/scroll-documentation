import Aside from "../../../../../components/Aside.astro"

You can send arbitrary messages from L1 to L2 or vice versa through the Scroll Messenger contracts. This means we can
execute functions on another chain in a secure and permissionless way. If you want to send a message from L1 to L2, use
the messenger smart contract deployed on L1. If you want to send a message from L2 to L1, use the contract deployed on L1.

<Aside type="caution" title="">
  When sending a transaction through the **Scroll Messenger** deployed on L1 and L2, the resulting transaction sender
  (`CALLER` or `msg.sender`) will be the Messenger Contract address deployed on the receiving chain. In future Scroll
  versions, enforced transactions will be introduced as a L1 contract. Sending enforced transactions will allow setting
  the sender on L2 as the original one on L1. It will also allow 3rd parties to relay signed transactions and also
  setting the&#x20;

### Finalizing transactions from L2

All upcoming transactions from L2 have to be finalized by using the `relayMessageWithProof` function on the Scroll Messenger.
This includes both arbitrary messages and asset transfers through the gateway and router. When calling `relayMessageWithProof`
you will need to provide the ZK proof of your transaction and other information as well. This can be done in a local and
permissionless way. You can also use our backend API running at `https://sepolia-api-bridge.scroll.io/api/`.
Supply the address of the EOA or contract that sent original transaction on L2 to the `/claimable` endpoint to retrieve
all the parameters needed to finalize the transaction on L1 like in the following example:

Any upcoming transactions from L2 need to be finalized using the `relayMessageWithProof` function on the Scroll Messenger
contract. This includes both arbitrary messages and transfering assets through a gateway or the router. When you use
`relayMessageWithProof`, you'll have to provide the ZK proof of your transaction along with other parameters. This
can be done in a locally and permissionlessly. Alternatively, you can retrieve the parameters through our backend API
at https://sepolia-api-bridge.scroll.io/api/.

Supply the address of the EOA or contract responsible for initiating the original transaction on L2 to the `/claimable`
endpoint. The API backend will provide you with all the necessary information to successfully conclude the transaction on L1.
Take a look at the following example:

```bash
https://sepolia-api-bridge.scroll.io/api/claimable?address=0x031407eaaffFB4f1EC2c999bE4477E52C81de3c5&page_size=10&page=1
```

The API should return your transaction data on the following format:

```json

  "errcode": 0,
  "errmsg": "",

    "result": [

        "hash": "0xa476850306d6ee52b127628ded34dcf2343570873cce9c5383bd497db48d4f9b",

```

The `claimInfo` object under the `result` json returned has all the information needed to execute your transaction on L1. The
parameters needed by the `relayMessageWithProof` are: `from`, `to`, `value`, `nonce`, `message` and `proof`. Supply them to
the `relayMessageWithProof` function on L1 to execute and finalize your transaction on L1.

### sendMessage

```solidity
function sendMessage(
  address target,
  uint256 value,
  bytes calldata message,
  uint256 gasLimit,
  address refundAddress
) external payable;
```

Sends arbitrary data from one chain to another. It allows us to execute functions cross-chain.

| target        | The address of account who receive the message. The receiver can be either a smart contract or a EOA wallet. |
| value         | The amount of ether passed when call target contract.                                                        |
| message       | The content of the message. This is the arbitrary calldata to be executed.                                   |
| gasLimit      | Gas limit required to complete the message relay on corresponding chain.                                     |
| refundAddress | The address of account who will receive the refunded fee.                                                    |

### relayMessageWithProof

```solidity
function relayMessageWithProof(
  address from,
  address to,
  uint256 value,
  uint256 nonce,
  bytes memory message,
  L2MessageProof memory proof
) external;
```

Relay a L2 => L1 message with message proof.

| to        | The address of the recipient of the message.                 |
| value     | The msg.value passed to the message call.                    |
| nonce     | The nonce of the message to avoid replay attack.             |
| message   | The content of the message.                                  |
| proof     | The proof used to verify the correctness of the transaction. |
